# JavaScript30
To get better at JavaScript, I decided to give myself the task of making one thing in vanilla JS every day for 30 days, from the wesbos [#JavaScript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) challenge. I'll avoid using the starter files unless completely necessary.

Check out my progress below.

# Day 1 
To *ahem* kick things off, I made a keyboard drum kit. Not quite as responsive or as loud as my own drum kit but definitely more neighbour-friendly. I sourced the .wav files online and used my own CSS. Learnt about sizing with rem with this one (I've been using px and % in everything up until now).
