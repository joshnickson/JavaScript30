# JavaScript30
To get better at JavaScript, I decided to give myself the task of making one thing in vanilla JS every day for 30 days, from the wesbos [#JavaScript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) challenge. I'll avoid using the starter files unless completely necessary.

Check out my progress below.

# Day 1 
To \*ahem\* kick things off, I made a keyboard drum kit. Not quite as responsive or as loud as my own drum kit but definitely more neighbour-friendly. I sourced the .wav files online and used my own CSS. Learnt about sizing with rem with this one (I've been using px and % in everything up until now).

# Day 2
This morning I made a real-time clock with CSS. I'm already amazed at how much you can make with a bit of CSS and JavaScript. This exercise taught me about the possiblities of *transform* in CSS and how to dynamically change the style of an element with JS.

*Fun fact: I finished this at midday so had to wait around for a minute to take the screenshot.*
